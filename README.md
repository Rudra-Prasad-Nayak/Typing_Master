# Typing Master

**Typing Master** is a modern, responsive, and fully-featured typing test application built with React, Vite, and Tailwind CSS. It helps users practice typing, enhance their speed and accuracy, and monitor performance through real-time statistics and result summaries.

## 🚀 Features

- 🔄 **Pause & Resume**: You can pause the test and resume without losing current progress.
- ✅ **Result Summary**: After completion, a popup displays your performance summary.
- 🔀 **Dynamic Paragraphs**: Generates new random content each session to keep the challenge fresh.
- 🧩 **Responsive UI**: Mobile-friendly design with clean layout and smooth transitions.
- 🎯 **Keyboard Navigation Support**: Enhanced accessibility with keyboard support.

## 🚀 Technologies Used
